# Eight Segment Decoder Project

### About:

For this project, I created a eight segment decoder and used VHDL code the decoder whose output is *sz_out*. A digital decoder is a device which converts one digital format into another. I used Binary Coded Decimal (BCD) to 8-Segment Display Decoder. The BCD to 8 Segment Decoder converts 4 bit binary to 8 bit control signal which can be displayed on 8 segment display. Eight display consist of 8 LED segmnets to display 0 to 9 and A to F.
