# Eight Segment Decoder Project

### About:

For this project, I created a eight segment decoder and used VHDL code whose output is *sz_out*. A digital decoder is a device which converts one digital format into another. I used Binary Coded Decimal (BCD) to 8-Segment Decoder. The BCD to 8 Segment Decoder converts 4 bit binary to 8 bit control signal. The icruit contains an input bundle of four singals and an output bundle of eight singals. The input bunle, D_IN, represents a 4-bit binary number. The output bundle, SZ_OUT, is used to indicate the magnitude of the 4-bit binary input number. The relationship between the input and output is hown in the tbale below.
