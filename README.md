# Eight Segment Decoder Project

### About:

For this project, I created a eight segment decoder with the use of VHDL code. The decoder has an output of *SZ_OUT*. A digital decoder is a device which converts one digital format into another. The Binary Coded Decimal (BCD) to 8 Segment Decoder converts 4 bit binary to 8 bit control signal. The circuit contains an input bundle of four signals and an output bundle of eight signals. The input bundle, *D_IN*, represents a 4-bit binary number. The output bundle, *SZ_OUT*, is used to indicate the magnitude of the 4-bit binary input number. The relationship between the input and output is shown in the table below.
